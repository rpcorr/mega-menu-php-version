1.like that the menu hangs around when clicking -- but it should eventually disappear to reveal the underlying page content when no longer hovered -- we don't want that to be immediate -- nor do we want it to be forever 

Maybe a 1s transition?


2. Fix menu structure into top level and sub menu items
3. On hover and move mouse off the menu - reset  dropdown menu to inactive (collapse menu)
4. Assign preference - theme colour -  value to user profile
5. “Drill down” menu into another section depending on what menu item the user clicks



when user log into to page and each page make have additional filter

sub-set of LibSat

drilldown

sessionData is empty when the user is not loggged in
